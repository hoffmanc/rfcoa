title: Notice of Overdue Condo Fees
---

This notice is automatically generated once any owner of an office or residential unit has unpaid condo fees that are 90 days or more past the invoice date of any given quarter. All payments made are used to reduce the balance of the oldest debt until that debt has been paid. This also applies to any special assessments that remain unpaid for the same period.

The RFCOA requires that all condo fees be paid quarterly at the latest, or monthly if you prefer. These fees allow us to exist as an association. Without them, we would not have funds to repair the building, pay for our flood and fire insurance, have lights in the hallways, doorways and stairs, have water which everyone uses, pay for snow removal when needed, pay for trash removal or many other essential services which we all enjoy.

The Board of Directors has met and decided that this problem has to be dealt with and the rules must be enforced in order to ensure the solvency of our association, and in order to be fair to all who do pay their dues in a timely fashion.  We all use the services provided, and to have the burden of paying for those services un-proportionally distributed simply is not fair.

The following is the collection procedure adopted by the Board:
1. Interest is accruing on your overdue balance at the rate of 18% annually.
2. You must provide the Board of Directors with a signed, written plan stating how you will become current with
your dues including all outstanding debt and interest. You will have one week to present this plan to any board
member. The Board will review the plan to make sure it is acceptable. If it is not, the Board will tell you what is
needed in order to make it acceptable.
3. If no plan is submitted, or the agreement you made is not kept, a Lawyer will be retained to collect your
delinquent dues. All legal fees related to this action will be added to your account.
4. Interest will continue to accrue for as long as there is any debt remaining in the over 90 days' category, even if an acceptable plan is underway. Interest stops accruing as soon as all debt is current (less than 90 days in arrears).

We ask that you take this notice seriously, as the Board of Directors can no longer afford to overlook this issue. If this notice is ignored, all legal actions available to the Board will be pursued immediately.

Thank you for your cooperation,

RFCOA Board of Directors
